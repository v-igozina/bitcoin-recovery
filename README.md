‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**:  WalletGen is a tool for research and education, and it is *not* meant for unauthorized access or any malicious activity. Use it responsibly and only with wallets you own or have been given permission to access.

## How It Works

WalletGen generates wallets using [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki), [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki), and [Bech32](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32) for Bitcoin.  For EVM-based chains like Ethereum, WalletGen employs the [Keccak256](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html) hashing algorithm.

The core function of WalletGen is to compare generated addresses against a database, as well as checking wallet balances in real-time using blockchain explorers. This allows you to find your lost BTC. WalletGen's C++ foundation provides a substantial increase in generation speeds, with performance primarily reliant on your CPU & GPU.

## Why Choose WalletGen for Bitcoin Recovery?

## How to Search for Lost Bitcoin & Ethereum Wallets with Balance

**Wallet Gen** helps you search for Bitcoin wallets with balances.

### Bitcoin (BTC) Wallet Search:

*   Press `3` or run `start_search_btc.bat` to search Bitcoin wallets using the internet. This might take longer.
*   Press `6` for the database search, which is faster.

### EVM Wallet Search (Ethereum, BNB, MATIC, etc.):

*   Press `5` or run `start_search_evm.bat` for an internet search.
*   Press `6` for the faster database search.

### Speed Considerations:

*   Your hardware, especially your GPU, impacts the speed.

Databases improve the speed of the search.

## The Program Found a Wallet ‚Äî What‚Äôs Next?

If WalletGen finds a wallet with a balance:
*   The search will **Stop** immediately.
*   The wallet details are **Displayed** in the console.
*   Data is **Saved** in the `found_wallets.txt` file.

### How to Access the Funds?

1.  Import the **mnemonic seed phrase** into any compatible crypto wallet (Metamask, Trust Wallet, Electrum, etc.).
2.  You can transfer the funds to your wallet.

>  Consider donating if a wallet is found.
